Angular webkit app starter
==========================

This project pretends to be a skeleton template for start Angular 2 Projects.
You can see the production version in [ragoo.mx](http://ragoo.mx).

### Installation instructions
After cloning this repo execute at the root project the next command:
<blockquote>
  npm i
</blockquote>
In order to install all dependencies.

After, run:
<blockquote>
  npm run serve
</blockquote>

And the app will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Building final code
In order to publish the website, we need to run:
<blockquote>
  npm run build
</blockquote>

This operation creates a "dist" folder, which contains all rendered code needed to production.

Before publish, you can check the final release version in your localhost simply running:
<blockquote>
  npm run serve:dist
</blockquote>
